> If you don't know what [Project AIRI](https://github.com/moeru-ai/airi) is, here's the introduction:
>
> [Project AIRI](https://github.com/moeru-ai/airi) aimed to build the ultimate virtual AI lives within the cyber spaces, we are currently targeting to re-create [Neuro-sama](https://www.youtube.com/@Neurosama).
>
> Funding? Startup?
>
> Currently, we have several parnership projects with other companies to build similar products, but I ([@nekomeowww](https://github.com/nekomeowww)) primarily self sponsored those most contributed members of both [@proj-airi](https://github.com/proj-airi) and [@moeru-ai](https://github.com/moeru-ai), for supporting their work. I'd love have a opportunity to work on this project in long term without worrying the funding. If you are, and indeed got interested in this project, please contact me.

> Who are we?

> We are a group of currently non-funded talented people made up with computer scientists, experts in multi-modal fields, designers, product managers, and popular open source contributors who loves the goal of where we are heading now.
