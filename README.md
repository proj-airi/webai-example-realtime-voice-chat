>
> Funding? Startup?
>
> Currently, we have several parnership projects with other companies to build similar products, but I ([@nekomeowww](https://github.com/nekomeowww)) primarily self sponsored those most contributed members of both [@proj-airi](https://github.com/proj-airi) and [@moeru-ai](https://github.com/moeru-ai), for supporting their work. I'd love have a opportunity to work on this project in long term without worrying the funding. If you are, and indeed got interested in this project, please contact me.
